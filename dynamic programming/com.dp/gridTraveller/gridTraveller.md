## Grid Traveller Problem Statement
LeetCode Problem: [https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths/]<br/>

There is a robot on an m x n grid. The robot is initially located at the top-left corner (i.e., grid[0][0]). The robot tries to move to the bottom-right corner (i.e., grid[m - 1][n - 1]). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

Given the two integers m and n, return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner.

The test cases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to 2 * 109.

## Grid Traveller Memoization Approach

 1. Make It Work<br/>
    <br/>1. Visualize problem as a tree
       (Sample Visualization for 3 * 3 grid)<br/>

    <br/>2. Implement the tree using recursion  
         3. Test it<br/>
    *Time Complexity*: O(2<sup>m+n</sup>)
    <br/>*Space Complexity*: O(m+n)
 2. Make it efficient
    1. Add a memo object(HashMap)</br>

       <br/>*Time Complexity*: O(m*n)
       <br/>*Space Complexity*: O(m+n)
